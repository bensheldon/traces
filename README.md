# Traces

Capture nested traces during code execution in a vendor agnostic way. As the author of many libraries which would benefit from tracing, there are few key priorities: (1) zero overhead if tracing is disabled, minimal overhead if enabled, and (2) a small and opinionated interface with standardised semantics. This gem provide such an interface. We implement a tracing interface which is largely consistent with the [W3C Trace Context Specification](https://github.com/w3c/trace-context).

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/traces/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/traces/actions?workflow=Development)

## Installation

    bundle add traces

## Usage

``` ruby
require 'traces'

class MyClass
	def my_method
		puts "Hello World"
	end
end

# If tracing is disabled, this is a no-op.
Traces::Provider(MyClass) do
	def my_method
		attributes = {
			'foo' => 'bar'
		}
		
		trace('my_method', attributes: attributes) do
			super
		end
	end
end

MyClass.new.my_method
```

If tracing is disabled, there is no overhead.
